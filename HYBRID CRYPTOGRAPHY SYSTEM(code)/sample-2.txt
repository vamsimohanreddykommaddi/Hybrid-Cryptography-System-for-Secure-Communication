to encrypt this message using a hybrid cryptography system we can first use the vigenere cipher the vigenere cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher that uses a keyword to encrypt a message the keyword is repeated along the length of the message and each letter of the keyword is used to shift the corresponding letter of the message this makes the vigenere cipher much more secure than simple substitution ciphers like the caesar cipher next we can apply the polybius cipher the polybius cipher is a simple substitution cipher that uses a five sized grid of letters to encrypt a message each letter of the alphabet is assigned a pair of coordinates on the grid and the letters of the message are replaced by their corresponding coordinates this makes the polybius cipher resistant to frequency analysis attacks as each letter is represented by a pair of coordinates rather than a single letter
